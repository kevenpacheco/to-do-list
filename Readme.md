## Overview

### About

This is Rocketseat's first Ignite challenge, on the React JS track. It is a task control application, in the task list style, which contains the following functionalities:

- Add a new task
- Mark and unmark a task as complete
- Remove a task from the list
- Show task completion progress

## My process

### Built with

- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [React JS](https://reactjs.org/)
  - Context API
- [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)
- [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/)

### What I learned

The challenge aims to remember the basic concepts of react, such as:

- States
- state immutability
- Lists and Keys in ReactJS
- properties
- Componentization

### Going beyond

To go a little further, I made some improvements to the project, such as:

- I created a small loading component using an animated svg, simulating the loading of information;
- I created a button that changes the application's theme between light and dark mode;
- Added unit tests, using Vitest and React Testing Library.
